## Some ideas

* use of piping in ggvis (as an introduction)
* `layer_images` as a replacement for `geom_raster`
* how to include css in your Rmd website
* using shiny runtime vs using simple html documents
* reactive form vs. Winston form
* date-times on axes
* axes and legend titles not reactive
* using an intermediate form as a workaround to non-standard evaluation
* using the intermediate form to flip axes on a histogram
* shiny widgets 
* `on_click`, `on_hover`
* there's something about subapps (only one level), ggvis sizing issues
* using a `NULL` data.frame as an input to ggvis
* don't use more than a few thousand geometries (yet)
