library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
library(shiny)
```

There is support for datetimes in ggvis, but there are "gotchas".

Let's take some time-series data:

```{r}
dtime <- seq(0, 29)*dhours(1)

df <- data.frame(
  instant = ymd("2014-09-10", tz = "America/Chicago") + dtime,
  value = 50 + 20*sin(2*pi*dtime/dhours(30))
)

glimpse(df)
```

And plot it:

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=3}
df %>%
  ggvis(x =~ instant, y =~value) %>%
  layer_points()
```

Change the time-zone on your computer. Go ahead, I'll wait. Now reload this page.

Weird, huh?

One possible fix (from the users' point-of-view) would be to be able to add a timezone arguement to `scale_datetime`.

Of course, ggvis is still under development, and they have a lot of things to take care-of before adapting a lubridate-type interface to `scale_datetime`. So, just something to be aware of for now.
