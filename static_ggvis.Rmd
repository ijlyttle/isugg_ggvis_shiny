```{r static, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)

cocaine %>% 
  mutate(price_wt = price/weight) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(m_price = mean(price_wt)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(m_price)) %>%
  mutate(rank = 1:45) %>%
  ggvis(x = ~m_price, y = ~state) %>%
  layer_points()

```

This is a static HTML document with a ggvis.

If you have no need for shiny-based interactivity, this approach can be useful. 

You can compile your site using a makefile (or jekyll, maybe). Check out the [makefile](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/blob/gh-pages/Makefile) that RStudio uses to build the RMarkdown site.

The benefits of using "non-shiny" html are:

* no need for a corresponding R session
* fast page-loads
* can be hosted at github pages
